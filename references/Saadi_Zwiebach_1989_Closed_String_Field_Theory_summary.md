## Abstract

A fully nonpolynomial framework for closed string field theory is studied. All interactions are geometrical—the pattern of string overlaps gives polyhedra with equal perimeter faces and three edges at each vertex. All interactions are cubic in the sense that at most three strings can coincide at a point. The three-point vertex used is that of Witten which is seen to be quite natural in the framework of quadratic differentials and to induce a very symmetric decomposition of moduli space.

## Key Concepts

### Polyhedral Decomposition
- String interactions map to polyhedra
- **Equal perimeter faces**: Each face has same boundary length
- **Three edges at each vertex**: Trivalent structure
- Geometric construction of string field theory

### Cubic Interactions
- At most **three strings coincide at any point**
- Mirrors Plateau's rule for soap films (three films meet at 120°)
- Simplifies interaction structure while capturing full physics

### Witten's Three-Point Vertex
- Natural in quadratic differential framework
- Induces symmetric moduli space decomposition
- Connects open and closed string field theories

### Moduli Space
- Space of inequivalent Riemann surfaces
- Polyhedra provide cell decomposition
- Each cell corresponds to specific interaction topology

## Mathematical Structure

### String Overlap Geometry
When three closed strings interact:
- Overlap regions form polygonal faces
- Faces tile a polyhedron
- Equal perimeter constraint from conformal invariance

### Vertex Properties
$$V_3: \text{Three-string vertex}$$
- Cyclic symmetry under string permutation
- BRST invariant: $Q V_3 = 0$
- Associativity requires higher vertices

### Nonpolynomial Action
$$S = S_2 + \sum_{n=3}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} V_n$$

Unlike Witten's cubic open string theory, closed strings require infinite tower of vertices.

## Relevance to Soap Bubble Simulation

### Direct Analogies

| Closed String Theory | Soap Film Network |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Polyhedron faces | Film segments |
| Equal perimeter | Equal tension |
| 3 edges per vertex | 3 films at 120° (Plateau) |
| Cubic interaction | Triple junction |
| Moduli space | Configuration space |

### Why Polyhedra?

The polyhedral structure emerges because:
1. **Minimal area** principle governs both strings and films
2. **Trivalent vertices** are energetically stable
3. **Equal perimeter** ↔ **Equal surface tension**

### Steiner Networks Connection

The Meng et al. (2026) paper on surface optimization shows:
- Soap films form Steiner-like minimal networks
- Same topological constraints as string vertices
- Polyhedra encode network topology

## Key Results

1. **Geometric framework**: All interactions from string overlaps
2. **Witten vertex naturality**: Quadratic differentials justify construction
3. **Moduli decomposition**: Symmetric cell structure
4. **Nonpolynomial necessity**: Closed strings need all-order interactions
