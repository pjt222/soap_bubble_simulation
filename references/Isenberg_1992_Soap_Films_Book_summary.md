## Key Concepts

### Surface Tension
- **Definition**: Force per unit length at liquid-air interface
- Units: dynes/cm or N/m
- Origin: Cohesive forces between molecules at surface

### Laplace-Young Equation
Pressure difference across curved interface:
$$\Delta P = \gamma \left(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}\right)$$

For a sphere ($R_1 = R_2 = R$):
$$\Delta P = \frac{2\gamma}{R}$$

For soap bubble (two surfaces):
$$\Delta P = \frac{4\gamma}{R}$$

### Minimal Surfaces
- Surfaces that minimize area for given boundary
- Soap films naturally form minimal surfaces
- Mean curvature $H = 0$ for minimal surfaces:
$$H = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}\right) = 0$$

### Plateau's Rules
1. Smooth films meet in **threes** along edges (Plateau borders)
2. Edges meet in **fours** at vertices
3. Films meet at **120°** angles
4. Edges meet at **109.47°** (tetrahedral angle)

### Interference Phenomena
- Colors from thin-film interference
- Film thickness determines reflected wavelengths
- Newton's rings and iridescent patterns

## Physical Problems Solved by Soap Films

| Problem | Soap Film Solution |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Motorway problem** | Steiner network connecting cities |
| **Minimum area** | Spanning surface for wire frame |
| **Plateau problem** | Finding minimal surface with given boundary |
| **Isoperimetric** | Maximum volume for given surface area → sphere |

## Relevance to Simulation

| Topic | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| **Surface tension** | Force calculations, energy minimization |
| **Laplace-Young** | Pressure-curvature relationship for bubbles |
| **Minimal surfaces** | Film geometry between constraints |
| **Plateau's rules** | Junction angles in bubble clusters |
| **Interference** | Color rendering from film thickness |
| **Molecular structure** | Understanding film stability |
| **Contact angle** | Bubble-surface interactions |

## Key Equations Summary

### Surface Energy
$$E = \gamma \cdot A$$

### Capillary Length
$$\lambda_c = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{\rho g}}$$

### Film Thinning (simplified)
$$\frac{dh}{dt} \propto -\frac{\rho g h^2}{\mu}$$

### Optical Path Difference
$$\delta = 2nh\cos\theta_r + \frac{\lambda}{2}$$
