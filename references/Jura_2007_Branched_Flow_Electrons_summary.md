## Jura et al. (2007) - Unexpected Features of Branched Flow Through High-Mobility Two-Dimensional Electron Gases

**Citation:** Jura, M. P., Topinka, M. A., Urban, L., Yazdani, A., Shtrikman, H., Pfeiffer, L. N., West, K. W., & Goldhaber-Gordon, D. (2007). Unexpected features of branched flow through high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases. *Nature Physics*, 3, 841-845.

**DOI:** 10.1038/nphys756
**arXiv:** 1009.3670

## Key Concepts

### Branched Flow Phenomenon
- **Definition**: When waves propagate through weak correlated disorder, they form narrow channels (branches) of enhanced intensity
- First discovered in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs)
- Universal phenomenon: observed in electrons, sound waves, water waves, light
- Branches keep dividing as waves propagate through the medium

### Two-Dimensional Electron Gas (2DEG)
- GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure confines electrons to 2D plane
- Extremely low disorder enables long mean free paths
- Mean free paths: microns to hundreds of microns at low temperature
- Basis for fast transistors, quantum computing prototypes

### Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM)
- Imaging technique for spatial structure of electron transport
- Provides direct spatial information beyond conventional measurements
- Enables inference about disorder potential in samples

## Key Findings

### Expected Behavior
- Electrons flow along narrow branches
- Branches remain straight over distance proportional to mean free path
- Branch length scales with sample mobility

### Unexpected Phenomena

| Finding | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Suppressed interference** | Highest-mobility sample shows complete absence of sharp impurity scattering; quantum coherent interference fringes completely suppressed |
| **Stability to initial conditions** | Branched flow through chaotic potential remains stable despite significant changes to electron injection conditions |

## Physical Parameters

### Sample Characteristics
- Three GaAs/AlGaAs 2DEGs studied
- Mobility range: order of magnitude variation
- Temperature: low (cryogenic)
- Mean free path: μm to 100s of μm

### Branching Mechanism
- Weak random potential (smooth disorder)
- Correlation length > electron wavelength
- Caustic formation focuses electron density
- Linear phenomenon (not requiring nonlinearity)

## Relevance to Simulation

| Topic | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| **Branched flow physics** | Background for Patsyk 2020 light branching in soap films |
| **Disorder correlation** | Soap film thickness variations act as correlated disorder |
| **Caustic formation** | Universal mechanism applies to light in thin films |
| **Stability** | Branched patterns robust to perturbations |
| **Mean free path scaling** | Branch length depends on disorder strength |

## Connection to Soap Bubbles

The branched flow phenomenon discovered in electrons was later observed in light passing through soap films (Patsyk et al. 2020). Key parallels:

1. **2DEG disorder** ↔ **Soap film thickness variations**
2. **Electron wavelength** ↔ **Light wavelength**
3. **Potential fluctuations** ↔ **Refractive index variations**
4. **Electron branches** ↔ **Light filaments**

Both systems require:
$$l_c > \lambda$$
where $l_c$ is correlation length of disorder and $\lambda$ is wavelength.
